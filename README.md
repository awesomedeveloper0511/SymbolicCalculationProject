# SymbolicCalculationProject

Hey there! 

I'll be updating the code in this repo as as I continue to work on this project.

Because I'm pretty new to using Machine Learning for 'Symbolic Data', 
so I'm sure there's a lot I can learn and plenty of room to optimize the models. 

So feel free to check back every now and then for any new developments. 

Thanks for stopping by!
