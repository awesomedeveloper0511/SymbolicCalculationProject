# SymbolicCalculationProject

Hey there! 

I'll be updating the code in this repo as as I continue to work on this project.

So feel free to check back every now and then for any new developments. 

Because I'm pretty new to using Machine Learning for 'Symbolic Data', 
so I'm sure there's a lot I can learn and plenty of room to optimize the models. 

Thanks for stopping by!
